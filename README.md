# dynasty-league

Dynasty-league is a small side project meant for helping me during my fantasy football drafts each year. It's main purpose is to be run from a Clojure REPL in Emacs, but the end goal is to have a front-end in JavaScript (using AngularJS) and a back-end in SQL or MongoDB. The front-end is currently just starting to be built out.
